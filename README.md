# Campus Connect – A Student Utility App ## Unit DAM Academic Year: 2025–2026 ## Project Title Campus Connect – A Student Utility App --- ## Project Description Campus Connect is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to streamline student life on campus. The application provides a centralized platform that allows students, teachers, and administrators to interact through a single system. The app includes features such as class schedules, exam notifications, a digital student ID card, course management, attendance tracking, file sharing, and peer-to-peer communication. All actors use the same application and login page, with role-based access and predefined accounts for administrators and teachers. --- ## Actors and Roles The application supports three main actors: ### Admin - Manage student registrations (accept or reject new accounts) - Assign students and teachers to groups - Assign courses to teachers and student groups - Delete student accounts - Upload schedules, timetables, and files (images or documents) - Manage overall system data ### Teacher - Access assigned courses and groups - Upload course-related files - Enter and modify student marks - Mark weekly attendance for students in their groups ### Student - Register for an account (registration must be validated by an admin) - View and edit personal profile information - Access a digital student card - View group schedules and timetables - Check marks per course - Access course files uploaded by teachers or admins --- ## Functional Requirements - Single application and login page for all actors - Role-based access control (Admin, Teacher, Student) - Predefined admin accounts - At least two predefined teacher accounts - Predefined courses and student groups - Admin validation required for new student registrations --- ## Technologies Used - Flutter framework for mobile application development - Database: - Any database type may be used (SQL, NoSQL, Firebase, etc.) - SQLite is not allowed - REST API with SQL database connection is recommended and better graded --- ## Project Sprints and Evaluation The project is evaluated as part of the DAM TP and counts for **11/20 of the total TP mark**. Each sprint has a separate mark. ### Sprint 1: Frontend and UI (3 points) - Design a user-friendly interface for each actor - Design a student card containing student information - Design a login page - Design a home page for each actor ### Sprint 2: Functions (2.5 points) - Fully functional admin panel: - Manage student registrations - Assign groups and courses - Upload timetables and schedules - Manage teachers (assign groups and courses) - Student pages: - View group information - View marks - View timetables - Access course files - Teacher pages: - View assigned courses - Upload and view course files - Modify student marks ### Sprint 3: Backend (2.5 points) - User registration and authentication using a database - Save and retrieve data from the database - Modify database data through the application - Upload images/files to the server - Partial implementation of database tables is accepted for partial grading ### Sprint 4: Enhanced Search and Responsive Design (1 point) - Improve search functionality - Ensure responsive design across different screen sizes --- ## Project Objectives - Simplify campus life for students - Centralize academic information and communication - Provide a practical application of Flutter development - Apply backend integration using databases and REST APIs --- ## Author Alix meissa Computer Science Student --- ## License This project is developed for educational purposes as part of the DAM unit.
